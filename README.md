# AetherMindAI

**A Lightweight, Multifaceted AI Assistant for Google Colab**

## Overview

AetherMindAI is an open-source AI assistant designed to bring versatile capabilities to your Google Colab environment. Powered by lightweight, quantized language models like Microsoft's Phi-2, AetherMindAI offers a unique blend of conversational reasoning, advanced symbolic mathematics, and practical machine learning demonstrations.

Its modular architecture makes it easy to understand, extend, and integrate into educational projects, hobbyist explorations, or as a starting point for more complex AI applications. Whether you want to chat, solve complex equations, or experiment with ML model training, AetherMindAI provides a responsive and resource-friendly experience directly within your browser.

## Features

## Setup Instructions (Google Colab)

AetherMindAI is designed to be run primarily in a Google Colab environment.

1.  **Open in Colab:**
    *   Click the "Open In Colab" badge above.
    *   Alternatively, go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and select `File > Open notebook > GitHub`, then enter the repository URL and choose the main project notebook (if one is provided, e.g., `AetherMindAI_Colab_Notebook.ipynb`) or upload individual `.py` files.

2.  **Clone the Repository (if not using a primary project notebook):**
    If you are setting up the environment manually in a new Colab notebook, you can clone the repository:
    ```bash
    !git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/AetherMindAI.git
    %cd AetherMindAI
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with the actual username or organization)*

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    AetherMindAI relies on several Python libraries.
    *   If a `requirements.txt` file is provided in the repository:
        ```bash
        !pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Alternatively, install them individually:
        ```bash
        !pip install transformers torch accelerate bitsandbytes sympy scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
        ```
    *(Note: `bitsandbytes` is often used for quantization with Hugging Face models like Phi-2. `accelerate` helps with model loading on different devices.)*

4.  **Download Model (if not handled by scripts):**
    The `phi2_colab_runner.py` script attempts to download and load the Phi-2 model. Ensure your Colab instance has internet access.

5.  **Run AetherMindAI:**
    Once the setup is complete and all modules are in place, you can run the main controller:
    ```bash
    !python aethermind_main.py
    ```
    This will start the interactive chat loop in your Colab cell output.

## Core Modules

AetherMindAI is built with a modular approach. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

*   **`phi2_colab_runner.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Handles the core conversational AI capabilities.
    *   **Functionality:** Responsible for loading the pre-trained language model (e.g., Microsoft Phi-2) and its tokenizer. It includes functions to generate text responses based on user prompts and conversation history. This module is central to the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to natural language.

*   **`colab_math_solver.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Provides symbolic mathematics solving capabilities.
    *   **Functionality:** Integrates with the SymPy library to parse and solve mathematical queries expressed in natural language or as equations. It can handle tasks like solving algebraic equations, differentiation, integration, limits, and more.

*   **`colab_ml_tools.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Enables basic machine learning task execution.
    *   **Functionality:** Uses the scikit-learn library to perform common ML tasks such as classification (e.g., Logistic Regression), regression (e.g., Linear Regression), and clustering (e.g., KMeans). It operates on synthetically generated datasets, making it easy to demonstrate and experiment with ML concepts without needing external data. Includes options for basic plotting of results in Colab.

*   **`aethermind_main.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Acts as the central controller and task router.
    *   **Functionality:** Initializes the AetherMindAI application. It includes logic to detect the type of task a user is requesting (chat, math, or ML) based on their prompt. It then routes the request to the appropriate module (`phi2_colab_runner`, `colab_math_solver`, or `colab_ml_tools`) and presents the result to the user. It also manages the interactive chat loop and conversation history.

## Usage Examples

Once AetherMindAI is running, you can interact with it through the command-line interface in your Colab cell. Here are a few examples:

**1. General Conversation:**

```
You: Hello, AetherMind! Can you tell me about the Phi-2 language model?

[AetherMind Chat]: The Phi-2 language model is a Transformer-based model developed by Microsoft... (AetherMind provides a detailed explanation)
```

**2. Solving a Math Problem:**

```
You: Solve the equation x^2 + 2*x - 8 = 0 for x

[Math Solver]: The solutions for x in the equation x**2 + 2*x - 8 = 0 are: [-4, 2]
```

**3. Requesting a Machine Learning Task:**

```
You: Can you run a k-means clustering task for me?

[ML Tool: Clustering]: --- Clustering Task Summary ---
Data Parameters: {'n_samples': 150, 'random_state': 42, 'n_features': 2, 'centers': 3, 'cluster_std': 1.0}
Model Parameters: {'n_clusters': 3, 'random_state': 42}
Inertia: ...
A plot has been generated (if data dimensions were suitable).
(Note: Plotting might be disabled or text-based in some console versions; full plotting in `colab_ml_tools.py` if run directly)
```

**4. Asking for a different ML task (e.g., Classification):**

```
You: Perform a classification analysis.

[ML Tool: Classification]: --- Classification Task Summary ---
Data Parameters: {'n_samples': 150, 'random_state': 42, 'n_features': 4, 'n_classes': 2, 'n_informative': 2}
Model Parameters: {'random_state': 42}
Accuracy on Test Set: ...
A plot has been generated (if data dimensions were suitable).
```
*(Actual output for ML tasks will include metrics like accuracy, R-squared, inertia, etc., and may generate plots if enabled and data is suitable.)*
